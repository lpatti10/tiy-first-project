Homework:

1. Go through the Try Git website - https://try.github.io/ - up until (including) challenge 12 (Pulling Remotely)
2. Create 3 different repositories on Github
One like we did in class. Create it on Github.com and then clone it on your computer
Create one on your computer and then push it to Github
Push your homework from yesterday to Github. Call the repository "tiy-first-project"
3. Once you have the repository for your "tiy-first-project" add at least 5 significant commits to it and push it to Github. When I view the commit log on Github I should see at least 5 different commits. Please make the commit message as detailed as possible and make sure to use some new HTML or CSS elements or attributes in each commit.
4. All of your repositories should include both a .gitignore and Readme.md file. Get in the habit of making sure these are always there.

IMPORTANT: Once you have completed your assignment, leave a COMMENT on this message with a link to your Github account.
